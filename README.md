### PhotoBrowser

PhotoBrowser is a dynamic image gallery generator
written in Python. It is meant to be used for your
image selection process on your local computer.

It runs a web server and serves images from a
local directory to your Browser. This allows
you to take a look at the photos in this directory
and should give you a couple of options to
select the best ones / delete bad ones and more.

#### Some ideas:

* Display if there is a related raw file.
* Let the user slide through all the images using a JS caroussel.
* Let the user delete bad JPEGs.
* Include an API call to generate all thumbnails at once.
* Clean up image directories (delete orphaned RAW files).
* Display EXIF information.
