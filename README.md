### PhotoBrowser

This is a project meant to be used for image
selection processes on a local computer.

It runs a web server and serves images from a
local directory to your Browser. This allows
you to take a look at the photos in this directory
and should give you a couple of options to
select the best ones / delete bad ones and more.


#### Some ideas:

* Show if there is a raw file
* Let the user slide through all the images using a JS caroussel
* Let the user delete bad JPEGs
* Generate and Store thumbnails in a subdirectory
* Clean up image directories (delete orphaned RAW files)
* Make EXIF information accessible
